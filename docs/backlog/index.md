# Backlog Index

> **Generated file — do not edit by hand.** Rebuild with `node scripts/rebuild-backlog.mjs`.

Every durable Bug and Backlog record in the repository, whatever its state.

**39 records** — 24 bugs under [`docs/bugs/`](../bugs/), 15 non-bug items under [`items/`](items/).

A bug record **is** its own backlog entry. There is no parallel item for it —
see [`README.md`](README.md) for why.
