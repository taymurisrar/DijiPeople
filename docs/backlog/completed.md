Terminal records: verified fixes, closed items, duplicates, things that turned
out not to be bugs, and explicitly accepted risks.

Kept, not deleted. A fixed bug is the evidence a regression test exists for
a real failure — which is what a future agent needs when it is about to write
the same defect again.
