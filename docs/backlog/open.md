# Open Backlog

> **Generated file — do not edit by hand.** Rebuild with `node scripts/rebuild-backlog.mjs`.

Active work: bugs that are `OPEN` / `IN_PROGRESS` / `FIXED` (fixed but not yet
QA-verified), and items that are `NEW` / `TRIAGE_REQUIRED` / `READY` /
`IN_PROGRESS` / `VALIDATING`.

The Architect reads this before planning any substantial change —
`BACKLOG_PRECHECK` in [`.agent/agents/architect.md`](../../.agent/agents/architect.md).
