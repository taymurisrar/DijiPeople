## What DijiPeople is

A multi-tenant SaaS HRM and business platform: one codebase, one database,
many tenants, built as a configurable product rather than a per-client build.

Four surfaces — the tenant product, the platform admin console, an Electron
attendance agent, and the public marketing site.

See [[dijipeople-platform-overview|DijiPeople Platform Overview]] for the full picture.

## Open Product Decisions

Questions where the engineering is understood and the **product answer**
**is not**. No agent may resolve one by implementing a side of it.

## How to read this

Generated from what the repository can actually evidence — source code,
architecture documents, QA runs and decision records. **Nothing here is
product intent that was not implemented.** Intent, meeting notes and client
feedback live in the hand-written folders of this vault, which no agent
writes to.

Where a generated note and a hand-written one disagree, the hand-written one
records what was *wanted* and this one records what was *built*. Both are
worth having; neither overwrites the other.
